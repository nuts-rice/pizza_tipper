## üçïüçï Pizza Tipper!
A simple MVP for a social platform for tipping content creators !
Every tip is about the cost of a pizza.
Content creators will post content and have the ability to highlight their content.
Tippers will tip creators and have the ability to highlight their tip.

## Pizza cost
Pizza cost is determined by the pizza oracle. This is a smart contract. Currently in development.


## Azero ID 
Users (both creators and tippers) will have the option to post content linked to their
azero id or to tip  another user's azero id, respectively
